<h2>Notice<h2>
I have not tested any of the other assets besides the main theme.css file. Theme only tested on Vencord.
<h2>Credits</h2>

All credits go to  b4t3s, i kinda feel like mine is a cheap ripoff lol.
my version removes the crt effect and uses the github font

<h2>About</h2>

This is my second discord theme!
Its goal is to mimic the look and feel of the VaultTec(r) terminals from Fallout 4!

<h2>Installation</h2>

Installing betterdiscord themes is really easy!
- Go into discord's settings
- Go to "Themes"
- Click on "Open theme folder"
- Move the .theme.css file you downloaded into the folder you just opened
- Click the checkbox in the top-right corner of the theme in discord to enable it

<h2>Customization</h2>

You can easily customize this theme by editing the .theme.css file! Just change the variables to whatever you want!
If you need help finding the right value(s), head on over to [the theme's website](https://B4T3S.github.io/Fallout4TerminalTheme/) which has a handy color-picker!

<h2>Need more help?</h2>

No worries! Just head on over to my <a href="https://discord.gg/6qd3SkP6Ch" target="_blank">Discord Server</a>, you'll be sure to find whatever help you need customizing over there! :)
